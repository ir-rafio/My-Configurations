# Precompiling <bits/stdc++.h>

1. Locate the include directory for the g++ compiler. The paths may vary based on the operating system and installation. Here are the common paths:

   Windows: `C://MinGW/lib/gcc/mingw32/{version}/include/c++/mingw32/`

   Linux: `/usr/include/c++/{version}/`

   - Replace {version} with the specific version number of g++.

2. Inside the mingw32 directory, go to the `bits` folder.
3. Pre-compile the stdc++.h header file by executing the following command in the command prompt or terminal:

   ```shell
   g++ -std=c++17 stdc++.h
   ```

   - This command compiles stdc++.h using the C++17 standard.

4. After the compilation is complete, verify that the stdc++.h file is compiled to stdc++.gch. This pre-compiled header file can significantly improve the compilation speed of your C++ programs.
